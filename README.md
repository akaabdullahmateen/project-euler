# Project Euler

This repository contains solutions to the problems I solved from the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) website.

## Notice

The sole purpose to create this repository was to practice git commands, and learn JavaScript (ECMAScript) enough to solve these challenges.<br>
In regards to publishing solutions to the Project Euler problems, the official website clearly points out that:

> It appears that you have answered your own question. There is nothing quite like that "Aha!" moment when you finally beat a problem which you have been working on for some time. It is often through the best of intentions in wishing to share our insights so that others can enjoy that moment too. Sadly, that will rarely be the case for your readers. Real learning is an active process and seeing how it is done is a long way from experiencing that epiphany of discovery. Please do not deny others what you have so richly valued yourself.
>
> However, the rule about sharing solutions outside of Project Euler does not apply to the first one-hundred problems, as long as any discussion clearly aims to instruct methods, not just provide answers, and does not directly threaten to undermine the enjoyment of solving later problems. **_Problems 1 to 100 provide a wealth of helpful introductory teaching material and if you are able to respect our requirements, then we give permission for those problems and their solutions to be discussed elsewhere._**

<br>

As it clearly stands out that the restriction to not share the solutions is to prevent others solving similar problems gaining a solution by simply searching online. I intend to only post the explanations and solutions to the first 100 problems, as emphasized by the blockquote above. Also, I believe that my repository currently does not get any other viewer than myself. As such, if this repository ever gets any attention, I will make sure to either make this repository private, or delete it all together.
